# Next-Word-Prediction-using-LSTM-model

## Project Overview
This project develops a next word prediction model leveraging the capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTM, a variant of recurrent neural network (RNN), addresses the challenge of vanishing gradients in standard RNNs by incorporating memory cells. These cells allow the network to retain or discard information over time, making LSTMs particularly effective for tasks requiring the understanding of long-term dependencies in sequence data, such as language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation.

## Features
Language Modeling: Utilizes LSTM to model the probability distribution of the next word in a sequence, given the preceding words.
Long-term Dependency Learning: Captures and leverages long-term dependencies between words and phrases for accurate predictions.
Dynamic Memory Adjustment: Employs input, output, and forget gates within each LSTM cell to manage the flow and retention of information.

## Model Architecture
This section should describe the specific architecture of your LSTM model, including the number of layers, hidden units, and any specific configurations tailored for next word prediction.
